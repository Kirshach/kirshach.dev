Welcome to my _new blog_! Here, I'm testing Astro's _.md_ capabilities.

## What I'm going to do here:

1. **I don't know**: I really don't. I'm not yet sure whether this blog is going to be technical or not.

2. **I don't care**: So far, it doesn't really matter. I'll decide later on, when I feel comfortable with Astro and when I more or less finish my personal page.

## What's next

Big things are to come. Lol. Here's a random [link to Google](https://google.com) (because why not?)
